# The audit tools, pinned. A new release of either can turn the build red on

# Both require the go directive in go.mod to be at least 1.26, which is the
# reason it is: the releases before these two were the last to build against
# 1.25, and 1.25 itself has stopped receiving security fixes.

# The toolchain the audit judges, named rather than inherited from the
# machine. govulncheck reports standard library vulnerabilities for the Go it
# runs under, so a developer on 1.27 would otherwise be told about the
# standard library of a toolchain no release is built with — in either
# direction, and silently. The CI matches go.mod by construction; naming the
# version here is what makes a local run say the same thing. It costs a
# toolchain download once on a machine that has a different Go, and nothing
# where it is already installed.
#
# The current patch of the 1.26 line. Behind by a patch it reports a standard
# library fix as still missing, which is a false alarm rather than a silence,
# so it is worth bumping but not urgent.
